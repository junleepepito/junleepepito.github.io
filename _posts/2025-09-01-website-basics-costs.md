# Website Basics: How It Works, Setup Costs, and Timelines (Philippines 2025)

This guide explains in very simple terms how a company website works, what is needed, how long it usually takes to make one, and realistic costs today (Philippines, 2025).

---

## The Basics

- **Domain name** — the address of your site (example: `yourcompany.com`).
- **Hosting / Server** — the land/building where your site lives online.
- **Design and Content** — how the site looks and what’s inside (text, images, info).
- **Development** — coding, structure, making buttons and forms work.
- **Extras / Features** — blogs, e-commerce, booking, galleries, etc.
- **Security & SSL** — keeps data safe, makes site trusted (`https://`).
- **Maintenance & Updates** — ongoing fixes and improvements.

## How Long It Takes

- **Basic company site** (4–7 pages, no fancy features): *1–3 weeks*  
- **Medium site** (10–20 pages, blog, simple e-commerce): *4–8 weeks*  
- **Large/custom site** (many features, integrations): *2–3+ months*

- Mobile responsiveness is essential  
- Good content (writing, photos, graphics) is as important as design
